    <h3>04/05/2021</h3>
    <h4>Introduction to HTML</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>What tags and attributes are and initial ways to use them. I already knew bits about head, h1-h6 and such as per the recommended FreeCodeCamp, but didn't know about e.g. emphasis. I had also previously been quite confused about images and that has helped a bit. Still some learning to go here though.</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>Using the practice site, I have made an ordered and unordered list and added images amongst others.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I hope to be able to do some more work before the next session to enable me to understand the anchor and href attributes and other parts which were covered towards the end of the lesson, as well as looking up relative image locations. With the amount of code promised to increase exponentially, I cannot afford to fall behind.</p>
